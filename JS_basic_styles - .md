#{Js Basic Styles}


**Javascript: Style Guide and Good Practices - (Work in progress)**

## Introduction
We'd like to build a set of recommendations to write better javascript. It is a good space to think, discuss, search and learn. We're inspired in several sources, which are at the bottom of this page.

As Douglas Crockford says:
> The long-term value of software to an organization is in direct proportion to the quality of the codebase. Over its lifetime, a program will be handled by many pairs of hands and eyes. If a program is able to clearly communicate its structure and characteristics, it is less likely that it will break when modified in the never-too-distant future.

> Code conventions can help in reducing the brittleness of programs.

> All of our JavaScript code is sent directly to the public. It should always be of publication quality.
