Presentation-layer-guide
========================

###This work is being developed by a team of Globant frontend developers to achieve a better implementation of Javascript, HTML and CSS best practices.
###The target is to get at least 3 major sections (javascript, css and html). Each one could be comprised for so many chapters as necessary.
###We think the less amount of text, the better reading. Less is more!
###Some stuffs require a discussion. There're different points of view. Github is a good environment to do it. Use Pull Request or Issues on each case.
