========================

###This work is being developed by a team of Globant frontend developers to achieve a better implementation of Javascript, HTML and CSS best practices.
###The target is to get at least 3 major sections (javascript, css and html). Each one could be comprised for so many chapters as necessary.
###We think the less amount of text, the better reading. Less is more!
###Some stuffs require a discussion. There're different points of view. Github is a good environment to do it. Use Pull Request or Issues on each case.





**Javascript: Style Guide and Good Practices - (Work in progress)**

## Introduction
We'd like to build a set of recommendations to write better javascript. It is a good space to think, discuss, search and learn. We're inspired in several sources, which are at the bottom of this page.

As Douglas Crockford says:
> The long-term value of software to an organization is in direct proportion to the quality of the codebase. Over its lifetime, a program will be handled by many pairs of hands and eyes. If a program is able to clearly communicate its structure and characteristics, it is less likely that it will break when modified in the never-too-distant future.

> Code conventions can help in reducing the brittleness of programs.

> All of our JavaScript code is sent directly to the public. It should always be of publication quality.
